<h4 id="daily-limits">How do daily post limits work on Cronnit?</h4>
<p>
  Each account on Cronnit has a daily post limit, which by default is a limit
  of 5 posts per day. You can schedule as many posts as you want and that the
  daily limit applies to when the posts will be posted to reddit. For example,
  you can login and schedule 30 posts to happen over the next month, one per day,
  without any issue. However, if you try to schedule 6 posts to happen in the same hour
  it will refuse to schedule the last one because of your daily limit.
</p>
<p>
  Please contact <code>support@cronnit.com</code> if you wish to
  have your daily post limit raised or wish to have a custom private server setup.
